							<p class="section-paragraph mb-0">First year Computer Science Honours student in a Software Engineering stream at Carleton University, living in Markham, Ontario. Interested in problem solving and finding ways to optimise code efficiency.
								Right now, I&#39;m focused on school and maintaining my spot on the Honour&#39;s List, but am excited for summer, during which I hope to invest my time in a company related to my field.<br /><br />The biggest learning experiences I&#39;ve
								had so far were collaborative school projects I completed, as they forced me to learn different programming strategies and cooperation tactics to help optimise the quality of the final product under a time constraint.</p>

						<p class="section-paragraph mb-1">I recently started learning how to incorporate existing API to serve my own purposes. This is an implementation of PyImageSearch&#39;s Facial Landmark API, as well as their Face Alignment that uses the <span
							 style="color: #74a373">dlib</span> and <span style="color: #74a373">OpenCV</span> libraries to detect faces in one image, and then output all their aligned versions as a collection of 68 points, outlining their main features.<br />I am
							hoping to eventually think of a way to analyse the similarity between 2 different faces, based on the type of their facial structure.</p>

						<p class="section-paragraph mb-1">My favourite project by far was last year&#39;s PokemonBattle, which was a group effort with 2 other people. It was exam season, and even under extreme time constraints, I got to design, program, and review
							many major parts of the game.<br />Even though it was faily tasking having to combine code with other people, it taught me the importance of clear, consice, and commented code. In the end, we achieved an amazing final product that impressed
							many.</p>

						<p class="section-paragraph mb-1">This one was a small predecessor to our final project - a typing game with similar Pokemon Graphics. It&#39;s not much, but it served to familiarise our team with the Greenfoot IDE that we were required to
							use.</p>
